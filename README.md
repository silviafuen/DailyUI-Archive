9. [Music Player](/009-MusicPlayer/009-MusicPlayer.gif)
    * I took a different approach, there isn't really a guide or tips on how to design a music player so I took the key elements and had fun this week, making a small desktop playlist app. Not the most logical, also lacking in some senses, but it helped me get my design juices flowing again(which is what I've been needing)
    * P.S. I made a light and dark version! (Wish I could of kept the color palette as small as possible tho)
